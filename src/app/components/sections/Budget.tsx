            We understand that showing up itself represents a significant
            financial investment for most of you. We wanted to have a
            full-weekend celebration to make the long travel worth it, and want
            to be fully transparent about the expected costs for you.
          </p>

            Friday: Guests pay for their own food and drinks
            <br />
            Saturday: All food and drinks are on us
            <br />
            <br />
            Please don&apos;t feel obliged to spend even more money on a
            present, you coming to celebrate with us is more than we could ask
            for! ðŸ«¶
